Phys. Chem.81, 2350(1977)] to simulate stochastic dynamics of chemically reacting systems.In this algorithm, it is assumed that all reactions occur instantly.Since Gillespie’s exact SSA was developed for chemical reaction systems without delay, it is apparent that Gillespie’s SSA cannot produce exact simulation results for chemical reaction systems with delays.   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNeg lecting delays in certain cases may still produce acceptable results, but in some delay-sensitive cases, such as delay-induced oscillators,neglecting delays in simulation will lead to erroneous conclusions.   &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To solve this problem an exact SSA for chemical reaction systems with delays，Delay SSA was proposed, based upon the same fundamental premise of stochastic kinetics used by Gillespie in the development of his SSA.","category":"page"},{"location":"Library/#Features","page":"Practice","title":"Features","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Library/#Installation","page":"Practice","title":"Installation","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Library/","page":"Practice","title":"Practice","text":"Install with Pkg, just like any other registered Julia package:","category":"page"},{"location":"Library/","page":"Practice","title":"Practice","text":"pkg> add PkgTemplates  # Press ']' to enter the Pkg REPL mode.","category":"page"},{"location":"Library/","page":"Practice","title":"Practice","text":"You can use it by","category":"page"},{"location":"Library/","page":"Practice","title":"Practice","text":"using DelaySSAToolkit\n....","category":"page"},{"location":"Library/#References","page":"Practice","title":"References","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"Library/","page":"Practice","title":"Practice","text":"[1]: Xiaodong Cai, \"Exact stochastic simulation of coupled chemical reactions with delays\", The Journal of Chemical Physics 126, 124108(2007). https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2710253.
